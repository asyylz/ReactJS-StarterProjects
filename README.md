            <summary>Project 1 : Accordion
            </summary>
            <br>

                <strong>Concepts:</strong>
                <br>
                <em>State Management:</em> Utilizing React's useState hook to manage the state of selected items
                (selected for single selection mode and multiple for multi-selection mode).
                <br>
                <em>Event Handling:</em> Handling click events on the accordion titles to toggle item selection and
                enable
                multi-selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Conditional Rendering:</em> Dynamically rendering content sections based on the selected items and
                the current
                selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Component Styling:</em> Applying CSS classes dynamically to style selected items and indicate their
                active state.
                <br>
                <em>Component Composition:</em> Structuring the Accordion component with reusable title and content
                sections,
                enhancing modularity and reusability.

            <summary>Project 2 : Random Background Change
            </summary>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>Description:</strong> The project is a simple color generator built using React. It allows users
                to create random colors in either HEX or RGB format. Users can click buttons to switch between the color
                formats and generate random colors accordingly.
                <br>
                <strong>Concepts:</strong>The project utilizes React Hooks, such as `useState`, to manage state
                variables and control the behavior of the color generator. It employs event handling and dynamic styling
                to allow users to toggle between HEX and RGB color formats and generate random colors with visual
                feedback.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Project 3 : Star Rating
            </summary>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>Description:</strong>The StarRating component renders a star rating system where users can hover
                over stars to preview their rating before clicking to select. It dynamically updates star icons based on
                user interactions, offering a visually intuitive rating experience.
                <br>
                <strong>Concepts:</strong><em><br>State Management with React Hooks (useState):</em>The component
                employs useState to manage the current rating and hover states, enabling real-time updates to star
                appearances in response to user interactions.<br>
                <em>Event Handling:</em>Event handlers such as handleClick, handleMouseEnter, and handleMouseLeave are
                implemented to respond to user actions, facilitating the selection and preview of star ratings.
            </p>

        <details>
        <summary>Project 4 : Image Slider / Image Slider With Style
        </summary>
        <br>
        <p> <strong>Description:</strong>The Image Slider app is a React component that displays a slideshow of images.
            It allows users to navigate through the images using left and right arrows or by clicking on thumbnails at
            the bottom.
            <br>
            <strong>Concepts:</strong>
            <em><br>Slideshow Navigation:</em> Users can move to the previous or next image using arrow buttons.<br>
            <em>Thumbnail Navigation:</em> Thumbnails below the slideshow provide an overview of all images. Clicking on
            a thumbnail switches to that image. <br><br>
            <em>Dynamic Styling:</em> Thumbnails and the main image change appearance to indicate the current selection.<br>
            <em>Responsive Design:</em> The app adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Image Slider:</strong>This app provides basic functionality for sliding through a collection of images. It likely focuses on core features such as navigation controls                 and imagetransitions without much emphasis on visual styling.<br><br>
            <strong>Image Slider With Style:</strong> In contrast, "Image Slider With Style" not only offers image navigation but also prioritizes aesthetically pleasing design elements. It             likely includes  custom styles, animations, and additional visual enhancements to create a more polished and engaging user experience.

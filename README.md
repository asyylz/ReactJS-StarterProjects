                <br>
                <em>State Management:</em> Utilizing React's useState hook to manage the state of selected items
                (selected for single selection mode and multiple for multi-selection mode).
                <br>
                <em>Event Handling:</em> Handling click events on the accordion titles to toggle item selection and
                enable
                multi-selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Conditional Rendering:</em> Dynamically rendering content sections based on the selected items and
                the current
                selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Component Styling:</em> Applying CSS classes dynamically to style selected items and indicate their
                active state.
                <br>
                <em>Component Composition:</em> Structuring the Accordion component with reusable title and content
                sections,
                enhancing modularity and reusability.

            <summary>Project 2 : Random Background Change
            </summary>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>Description:</strong> The project is a simple color generator built using React. It allows users to create random colors in either HEX or RGB format. Users can click buttons to switch between the color formats and generate random colors accordingly.
            <br>
            <strong>Concepts:</strong>The project utilizes React Hooks, such as `useState`, to manage state variables and control the behavior of the color generator. It employs event handling and dynamic styling to allow users to toggle between HEX and RGB color formats and generate random colors with visual feedback.

            <br>
            <strong>Concepts:</strong><em><br>State Management with React Hooks (useState):</em>The component employs useState to manage the current rating and hover states, enabling real-time updates to star appearances in response to user interactions.<br>
            <em>Event Handling:</em>Event handlers such as handleClick, handleMouseEnter, and handleMouseLeave are implemented to respond to user actions, facilitating the selection and preview of star ratings.
